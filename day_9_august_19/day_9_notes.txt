Functions 
=========
-function is a block of code/statements designed to perform a particular task.

a. function declaration (named function)
b. function expression(anonymous)
c. self invoked ( IIFE- Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
d. arrow function (ES - 6)(2015)


Function declaration vs Function Expression
============================================
1. function declaratons are named functions, function expressions are anonymous
2. function declarations are hoisted, function expressions are not hoisted

Self Invoked
============
1. anonymous
2. when we want to invoke a function only 1 time



Arrow function
===============
Regular Function :  this = how/where the function is invoked
                    'this' is not static

arrow function : this = where the function is written
                 'this' is static


Arrow Function Limitations
===========================
1. don't use arrow function as object methods
2. don't use arrow function, when value of 'this' should be dynamic
