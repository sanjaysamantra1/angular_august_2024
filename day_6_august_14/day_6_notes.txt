DataTypes
=========
1. Primitive (number,string,boolean,undefined,symbol,bigint)
2. Non-Primitive (Object)

-Primitives are immutable , Non-Primitives are mutable
-Primitives are compared by value , non-primititves are compared by reference


undefined vs null
==================
-when a variable is declared but no value is assigned to that variable, by default undefined value gets assigned by javascript.
-datatype for undefined value is 'undefined'

-null is a value assigned by developers intensionally
-datatype for null value is 'object'

Note: even though datatype for 'null' value is object, null is a primitive value



Variables
=========
-in javascript, variables are declared by using either of the below 3 keywords
1. var
2. let
3. const


    var						let						 const
======================================================================
1.since begining		 1.ECMASCRIPT-6(2015)		1.ECMASCRIPT-6(2015)
2.value can be changed   2.value can be changed     2.cann't be changed
3.initialization is		 3.initialization is		3.mandatory
	not mandatory           not mandatory	
4.can be redeclared		 4.cann't be redeclared		4.cann't be redeclared
5.TDZ - No			 	 5.TDZ - Yes				5.TDZ - Yes
6.function/global		 6.block/function/global	6.block/function/global


Temporal Dead Zone
==================
-The period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed. 
 This period is the temporal dead zone (TDZ).
-The state where variables are un-reachable. They are in memory, but they aren't usable.
-The let and const variables exist in the TDZ from the start of their enclosing scope until they are initialized.
-if a let/const variable is accessed before its declaration, it would throw a ReferenceError. Because of the TDZ.
