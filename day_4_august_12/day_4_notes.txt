Javascript
==========
-Javascript is dynamically typed , synchronous & Single-threaded Programming language.
-Javascript Engine executes code from top to bottom line by line.
-Javascript engine has only 1 'callstack', hence it can do only 1 thing at a time.

var a = 5;
a = 'sachin';
a = true;
a = [];

-A Javascript engine is a program or an interpreter which resides inside every browser that helps
to execute javascript code.

V8               - Google , chrome
Spider Monkey    - mozilla , firefox
Javascript core  - safari
Chakra           - IE


Types Of Javascript
===================
1. Internal
    <script>Javascript Code</script>
    head or body
    page level javascript

2. External
    A Separate Javascript file is created
    include that js file in HTML using <script>
    Application level


What is the best place to include javascript file
==================================================
head section
body section


No defer or async, in the head
No defer or async, in the body
With async, in the head
With defer, in the head


Eliminate Render-Blocking JavaScript
====================================
-With HTML5, we got two new boolean attributes for the <script> tag : async and defer.
 ex:- <script src='demo.js' async/defer></script>
-async/defer attribute should only be used on external scripts, not with internal scripts.
-These attributes only make sense while using the script in the head portion of the page.
-async attribute ensures that the JavaScript file is loaded asynchronously in the background and does not block rendering.
-defer attribute tells the browser to run the script after the document has been parsed
-With async, the file gets downloaded asynchronously and then executed as soon as itâ€™s downloaded.
-With defer, the file gets downloaded asynchronously, but executed only when the document parsing is completed.
-With defer, scripts will execute in the same order as they are called. 
 defer is useful when a script depends on another script.
